## üåü Overview

The **Theological Analysis Framework (TAF)** is a systematic methodology for analyzing theological claims through structured examination of **what people actually preach and practice** versus theoretical doctrines. Designed for scholars, students, and interfaith dialogue practitioners, TAF bridges the gap between academic theology and lived religious experience.

## üéØ Purpose & Vision

### Primary Objectives
- **Real-World Analysis**: Examine actually practiced beliefs vs theoretical doctrines
- **Practical Theology**: Focus on devotional practices and popular preaching
- **Contemporary Relevance**: Address current theological debates and social impacts
- **Critical Engagement**: Analyze how religious figures actually shape daily devotion

### Target Audience
- Theology and Religious Studies Scholars
- Interfaith Dialogue Practitioners
- Philosophy Students and Researchers
- Religious Community Leaders
- AI/ML Developers working with theological datasets
- Anyone interested in understanding real-world religious practice

## üåç Real-World Theological Focus

This framework uniquely addresses the **gap between theological theory and religious practice** by analyzing:

### üîç What People Actually Preach
- Popular sermons and contemporary teachings
- Social media theological content and influencers

### Core Methodology
TAF operates through a **real-world focused** analytical process:

#### 1. **Lived Theology Analysis**
- Analysis of **actually practiced** beliefs vs theoretical doctrines
- Focus on **devotional practices** and **popular preaching**
- **Real-world theological debates** rather than academic abstractions

#### 2. **Key Figure Examination** 
- **Founder/prophet character** analysis (Muhammad, Christ, etc.)
- **Teacher influence** (Shankara, Ramanuja, etc.)
- **Historical vs contemporary** interpretation gaps

#### 3. **Practical Application Mapping**
- How doctrines **actually affect** daily life and ethics
- **Modern reinterpretations** of ancient texts
- **Social impact** of theological positions

#### 4. **Claim vs Counter-Perspective**
- **Supporting Evidence**: Scriptural, historical, experiential
- **Counter-Perspectives**: Internal and external critiques
- **Synthetic Analysis**: Reconciliation and open questions
